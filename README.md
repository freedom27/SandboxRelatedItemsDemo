# SandboxRelatedItemsDemo
Demo project about how to deal with "Related Items" in a Mac sadboxed app

The related items feature of App Sandbox lets your app access files that have the same name as a user-chosen file, but a different extension.

This project is about a small sandboxed app for OSX that open a file and write on a disk a different file with the same name of the opened one but with a different extension.
